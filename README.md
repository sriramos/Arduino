5 DOF Robotic Arm Controller

The controller has 5 potentiometer, one to control each motor. It would then send information over the I2C bus to the PCA9685 to control the servos.  Analog inputs A4 and A5 on the Arduino Uno used as the SDA (Data) and SCL (Clock) lines on the I2C bus to communicate to PCA9685.
